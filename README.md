# About
FrontEnd designed with Javascript, backend built with Node.js and MongoDB.
This basic web app aims to display and compare advanced NHL offensive and defensive skater metrics.
The four stats tracked are:
Goals for per 60 minutes played (GF/60)
Expected  goals for per 60 minutes played (xGF/60)
Goals against per 60 minutes played (GA/60)
Expected goals against per 60 minutes played (xGA/60)

# How to Use and Results
To use this application simply enter an NHL players name into one of the search bars and their resulting stats 
will be displayed. An example of using the resulting graphs for player comparison can be seen if we enter player Auston Matthews on the left
and player Leon Draisaitl on the right, the resulting graphs will depict stellar offensive metrics between the two, while Draisaitl's defensive metrics fall below 0. Thus conclusions can be drawn from these graphs that Draisaitl is a more one-dimensional offence only player while Matthews impresses on both ends of the ice.

All data was collected via NaturalStattrick.
